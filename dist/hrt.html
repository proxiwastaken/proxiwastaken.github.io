            <h2>intro</h2>
            <p>
                transgender people have to wait through excruciating wait times in order to access the healthcare they
                deserve. when people finally get
                their healthcare, the dosages can be much lower than what is required, and people also report getting
                their medication cut off as there isn't
                enough stock. people have been prioritised based on their "risk factor", aka the likelyhood that they
                will kill themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                due to extremely low dosages given out by public and private health sectors in the uk (from anti-trans
                lobbying and general moral panic).
                timelines can vary massively from person to person. looking up the effects of hrt on the internet can be
                very misleading as most easily available
                information focuses on cisgender individuals and the effect that hrt has on cis bodies (with much higher
                dosages for treating conditions such as prostate cancer).
            </p>
            <p>
                it has to be said, this comes from the perspective of a trans woman trying to recieve treatment in
                scotland (uk). this is why i've created this timeline.
                education and understanding of trans people's treatment is completely misunderstood. i hope this
                timeline can help people understand the process and perhaps
                help some other people start their own journey, choosing whatever method works best for them.
            </p>

            <p>
                today i start my hrt timeline. the first few weeks are exciting, but the effects are subtle. the first
                thing i noticed was my libido dropped from the face of the earth.
                bicalutamide reportedly preserves sexual function better than alternate anti-androgens, so results may
                vary significantly depending on your regimen. i'm not going to go into
                too much detail, however i have been largely uninhibited sexually except from the drop in libido.
                <br>i think my skin is much smoother than it was a couple of weeks ago. it's hard to notice as i have
                been dealing with excema since i was a child. it could be completely placebo but
                i swear my bed feels so much softer now.
                <br>the most noticable effect by far is my boobs growing in. whenever any pressure is put on my chest it
                feels like a sharp stabbing pain. my areola has puffed up slightly and there is
                much more fatty tissue making up my boobs.
                <br>im excited to see where i will be in a few weeks. the process has been very fast so far, most likely
                because I started on a regular dose, rather than slowly ramping up.
